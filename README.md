# PDA packages - some useful Debian packages 

This repo contains a few small Debian metapackages (i.e., packages that do not contain any files but only define other packages that should be installed).
The scripts and raw lists for generating the packages are also included.

Additional interesting tools that are not included in Debian:

* Arduino IDE
* [Baudline](http://www.baudline.com/) - signal analyzer
* Fritzing
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - cross-platform Git GUI (commercial)
* [Master PDF Editor)[https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/] - cross-platform PDF editor (commercial)
* Seafile
* ViewGlob
